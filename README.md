# Developer notes

## Create and use local builds of the library

First build and publish OPENRNDR 0.4 SNAPSHOT (using `-Prelease.version=0.5.1-SNAPSHOT`) from the `openrndr-0.4` branch.  

run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Prelease.version=0.5.1-SNAPSHOT` (or import in IntelliJ IDEA and edit the run configuration)

In an [`openrndr-template`](https://youtu.be/saAzoREfa90?t=787) based project set `orxUseSnapshot = true` in order to use the snapshot build.
